# Minimum-Spanning-Tree
Lab #3 CSCI 232. A program to find minimum spanning trees using three different algorithms in Java.

The program reads in a graph using two different text files, labels and graph data. 
It finds a minimum spanning tree using three different algorithms: Prim's, Kruskal's, and Floyd-Warshall's. 
In the case of Floyd-Warshall's algorithm, intermediate steps are printed to observe how the algorith acomplishes its goal.

NOTE: The Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms are currently not functioning as intended for some graphs.
